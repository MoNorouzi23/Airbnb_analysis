## ⭐️ Project Summary

**Project Website:** 

This project aims to perform statistical analyses on the listing with New York City Airbnb listings from 2019 dataset and develop a forecasting algorithm to forecast the price of the property . Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings.
